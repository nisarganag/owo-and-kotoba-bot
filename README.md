# owo-and-kotoba-bot

Prerequisites

Step 1 : import pyautogui for mouse cursor movement and keyboard inputs (pip install pyautogui).

Step 2 : import open from AppOpener (pip install appopener).

Step 3 : import cv2 (pip install opencv-python).

Step 4 : import numpy (pip install numpy).

Step 5 : import pytesseract for screen reading and error recognition (pip install pytesseract and pip install tesserocr). If tesseractocr is installed in some other location provide the address of the location of tesseract.exe by replacing Line 14.

Step 6 : Change the coordinates in the code (x1,y1,x2,y2) Line 29-32 as per your screen. Try to align the ocr rectangle box where the error messages appear.

Step 7 : Line 126 and 128 needs to be changed. Change the coordinates of your mouse cursor where your Discord server lies. Line 126 includes the coordinates of your discord server from the server list on the Left Hand Side of discord.
Line 128 includes the coordinate of the text box of the particular channel where the bot works.

Step 8 : Keep the default channel set to the channel of the owo bot so that only by clicking on the server icon the owo bot channel is opened and the bot can start working.

The Bot Works when discord is opened or closed or minimized.

DONE!!

Run the python script and enjoy
